I have used these scripts to generate tons of
[QuickStatements](https://tools.wmflabs.org/quickstatements/) to add
data into Wikidata.  The focus of the past period has been on
completing and updating social media details.  These scripts are
work-in-progress, and the aim is to end up with fully-automated
toolkit (and at that stage, QuickStatements shouldn't be part of the
workflow).

I am deeply greatful for the faciniation and inspiration that the
Wikimedia movement has been giving for many, many years.
